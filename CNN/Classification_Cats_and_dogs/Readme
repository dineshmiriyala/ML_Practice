Here is an classic example of Convolution neural network. This model's job is do classification between cats and dogs. I have used a predefined model from 
keras. It is called ResNet50. It has 48 neural layers, one MaxPool layer and one average layer. It is mainly used for classification purposes mainly on 
images. 

I have uploaded ipynb file including with zip file of data.
