dataset used for this neural network is CIFAR-10 dataset: It has 10 classes of different objects, about 10000 images for
each class, it is a predefined dataset from torchvision datasets. I will be building neural network from scratch.
I will be using convolution neural networks for this and I will
be defining model from scratch. I am using PYTORCH for faster training and GPU support.
here is the dataset link for reference https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html 
    steps:
    1. load and normalize the data.
    2. Define the convolution network.
    3. Define loss function and optimizer.
    4. Train the model on training dataset.
    5. Test the model on test datset.
    
The main goal of this project to demonstrate how to create and run a convolution neural network from scratch. Remaining all details are in main.py including details and thought process.
